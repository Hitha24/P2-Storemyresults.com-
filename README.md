As students complete each semester, they tend to forget marks of previous semesters. Hence it
might become tougher for students whenever the situation comes where they have to get their or 
remember previous semesters marks. Hence, we developed a User-friendly website to store and 
retrieve each semester marks.
The User has to Register themselves with the required details asked. Later the user can login. 
Once the user login user will be redirected to the Homepage. In homepage Each semester will be 
displayed. The user has to select the semester which user have to Store the marks in. Once the 
user enters the particular semester web page, he/she can enter the Subject Code, Subject Name 
and Marks of the Particular subject. The data will be displayed in the Result View. If the user 
wants to delete the Data, user can use the Delete button adjacent to the Particular Data Row. 
Once All the Details are added user can Download the PDF for future Reference, which
becomes more useful for the students. Once user enters all the required marks in respective 
semester user can Logout.
The Data are well secured allowing only distinct Email-IDs. The Data are stored in MySQL 
Database, where data are stored and retrieved when required as per the operations.
This makes the project user-friendly and efficient to use
